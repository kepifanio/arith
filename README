Assignment Purpose: 
	Take a PPM image and compresses the image via lossy compression.

Architecture:

	40image → compress40 → input_output → compress_decompress → bitpack

	40image: takes a file from the command line or STDIN and passes
    it on to compress40. Runs compress or decompress based on the users
    specification.

	compress40: handles both the compression and decompression of the
    passed file. All helper functions called from compression_conversions
    for both compression and decompression.

    input_output: reads in input files for both compression and
    decompression, and prints the resulting image to stdout.

	compress_decompress: does all the computation behind both
    compressing and decompressing the image. Hides the content of
    bitpack from compression40

	bitpack: holds all the bit wise functions used in
    compression_conversion that actually pack and unpack the 32-bit word.

Help Received:
	Received help from 3 different TA’s

Correctly Implemented:
	To the best of our knowledge everything has been correctly
      implemented.
        40image
        compress40
        input_output
        compress_decompress
        bitpack

      After passing in an image to be compressed, and then passing
      it back to be decompressed, we have an average difference
      between the final outputted image and the original image of
      1-2%.
